# Editable Campaign Pages Demo

We have many campaign pages, and we want to edit the data on the pages without having to redeploy the entire site. 

We store the data of each page as a json string in the database. The json string contains the data of the page, such as the title, description, and the image.

Admins should be able to edit the data on admin panel in regular forms, instead of editing a long json string.
